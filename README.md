JGProgressView
-------------------

![sample image](http://j-gessner.de/general/images/JGProgressView.png)


Setup
=====
1. Add the `JGProgressView` folder to your Project

2. Add the **QuartzCore** framework to your project.

2. `#import "JGProgressView.h"`

Usage
=====

It is used like a normal UIProgressView with the addition of a few properties:


**BOOL indeterminate**

- Property for the indeterminate setting, default is NO, set to YES to start the indeterminate animation


**NSTimeInterval animationSpeed**

- Adjust the speed of the animation. The higher the value is, the slower the animation becomes. Default value is 0.5, negative values will be ignored


**BOOL animateToRight**

- Default value is NO, when set to YES the animation switches over to animating to the right instead of left


**BOOL useSharedImages**

- Set this property to YES when using more than 1 progress views with identical animation related-properties (bounds, progressViewStyle, animateToRight) for improved performance (ex. in several UITableViewCells)
- DO NOT set this property to YES on more than 1 progress views if their animation related-properties (bounds, progressViewStyle, animateToRight) are different for each view.


**Additional functionality**

`beginUpdates`
`endUpdates`
when changing multiple properties that affect the animation related-properties (frame, progressViewStyle, animateToRight) in one code block, use beginUpdates before applying these changes and endUpdates after applying the changes to increase performance


###Short demonstration:

	JGProgressView *progressView = [[JGProgressView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(100, 100, 200, 11)];
	[self.view addSubview:progressView];
	progressView.useSharedImages = NO;
	progressView.animateToRight = YES;
	progressView.animationSpeed = 1.5f;
	progressView.indeterminate = YES;


__*Important note if your project doesn't use ARC*: you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to `JGProgressView.m` in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.__
